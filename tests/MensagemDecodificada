life is a journey# enjoy the ride#
the stars shine brightest on the darkest nights#
a smile is the best accessory you can wear#
failure is not the opposite of success# it#s a part of it#
the early bird catches the worm# but the night owl catches the fun#
believe in yourself# and you can achieve anything#
the best things in life are often the simplest#
time heals all wounds# but memories remain#
