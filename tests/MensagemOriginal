Life is a journey, enjoy the ride.
The stars shine brightest on the darkest nights.
A smile is the best accessory you can wear.
Failure is not the opposite of success, it's a part of it.
The early bird catches the worm, but the night owl catches the fun.
Believe in yourself, and you can achieve anything.
The best things in life are often the simplest.
Time heals all wounds, but memories remain.
